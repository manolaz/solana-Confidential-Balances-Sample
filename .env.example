# Solana Confidential Transfers Cookbook Environment Configuration

# ==== REQUIRED CONFIGURATION ====
# RPC_URL: Required for all recipes and ingredients

# ==== RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATION ====
# While not strictly required (will be auto-generated if missing), 
# maintaining a consistent fee payer in your .env file is highly recommended.
# This prevents you from having to fund a new fee payer each time runtime_output.env is deleted.
# The auto-generated fee payer will be stored in runtime_output.env, not .env.
