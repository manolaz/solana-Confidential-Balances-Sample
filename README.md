# Confidential Transfers Cookbook

A collection of ingredients (tests) and recipes (test sequences) demonstrating Solana Confidential Transfer patterns.  

Examples in this repository are standalone demonstrations of confidential transfer flows, similar to those found in the [Token Program CLI](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-program-library/tree/master/token/cli).

Use this as a guide to implement confidential transfer in your own applications.  
Although the API is still work-in-progress, the usage patterns remain stable.
